# Nothing above this directory is directly accessible from within the game.
# This does *not* have to be a subdirectory of the driver. It can be any
# directory in the filesystem.

# This can be overridden from the command line with the `--lib` / `-l` options

# Directories are searched in the order given here, and the paths are in-game paths,
# rooted at, and relative to `lib_dir`.
#
# This can be overridden from the command line with the `--includes` / `-i` options.
# Multiple directories passed on the command line can be separated by a comma.
# Where applicable, the mudlib itself can also override this setting directly.
